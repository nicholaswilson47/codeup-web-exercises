// Handle An API Promise
// Create a file named promises.js inside of your js directory and link it to an HTML file of your choice.
//
//     Generate a Personal Access Token for the GitHub API.
//
//     We will use this so that we don't get rate limited when talking to the GitHub API. You can add the token to your requests like this:
//
//
// fetch(url, {headers: {'Authorization': 'token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'}})
// Create a function that accepts a GitHub username, and returns a promise that resolves returning just the date of the last commit that user made. Reference the github api documentation to achieve this.
//
//     Create Your Own Promise
// Write a function named wait that accepts a number as a parameter, and returns a promise that resolves after the passed number of milliseconds.
//
//
// wait(1000).then(() => console.log('You\'ll see this after 1 second'));
// wait(3000).then(() => console.log('You\'ll see this after 3 seconds'));
// 1. As a bonus make sure the promise resolves with the milliseconds in return, so you can make the console log message more dynamic.
